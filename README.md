# my2-Boda
## My name is Partha Sarathy Boda. I am from India
### My favourite location spot is Hyderabad.
I liked the my city Hyderabad because it is  a major IT hub and is referred to as the **Cyberabad** of India. Hyderabad and Secunderabad are **twin cities** near Hussain Sagar Lake (also known as **Tank Bund** in local parlance) but both cities have grown so much that now they have become one **big metropolis**.

1.My Favourite Vacation spot.
1. **Hyderabad charminar**: It is one of the biggest monument which is located at Hyderabad,Telangana
2. **Salar Jung Museum** : This museum is located in hyderabad near Musi river and it is one of the finest museum in Hyderabad where we can see oldest  monuments & priceless books.
3. **Wonderla**: It is water Adventure park which is located in Hyderabad.
