## My name is Partha Sarathy Boda. I am from India
### My favourite location spot is Hyderabad.
I liked the my city Hyderabad because it is  a major IT hub and is referred to as the **Cyberabad** of India. Hyderabad and Secunderabad are **twin cities** near Hussain Sagar Lake (also known as **Tank Bund** in local parlance) but both cities have grown so much that now they have become one **big metropolis**.
